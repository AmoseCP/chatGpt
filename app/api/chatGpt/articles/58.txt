Dark Places

And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. Luke 22:44 NKJV

 In our gratitude for the resurrection, we can readily forget that Jesus endured dark hours of anguish prior to rising on the third day. Though our Savior was aware that His death would be temporary, He was troubled. Jesus sought the comfort of disciples who failed to stay awake and pray with Him. Perhaps, that is why our Lord is so patient with us when we feel alone in the dark and struggle with life’s challenges. An unexpected medical report, job loss, or passing of a loved one can quickly leave us feeling isolated and paralyzed by fear.

Unlike Jesus, we don’t know what comes next. Rarely do we have an end date for our trials. Still, growth and transformation are often preceded by seasons of difficulty. It is necessary that we experience hardships that ultimately forge us into better people. These dark times can bury us if we allow them. However, when we remember that Jesus was also in a dark place, we can find comfort knowing that He recognizes our pain even when we don’t have words to express our distress.

Our trials are never intended to bury us. Instead, we are planted like seeds. Seeds generate deep roots under pressure, seemingly isolated from the warmth of the sun. It is in the dark that we mature, expand our faith, and seek the Lord with fervor. The storms we endure facilitate growth. The silent Saturdays between misery and miracle forge us into better versions of ourselves.

The pressure of this world produces endurance and wisdom when we allow it. If our Savior suffered prior to His resurrection, we should expect no less. As we respond prayerfully and submit to the Father, we also please Him. God is glorified by our transformation. Accepting a new life in Christ allows our dark times to produce character, obedience, and innovative ideas. Though difficult, we don’t have to fear our dark times.

Every person God plants eventually finds the Light.

Reflect on a dark period in your life that God pulled you through. How did you behave while you waited for a resolution?

How can you encourage someone currently going through a demanding situation?
