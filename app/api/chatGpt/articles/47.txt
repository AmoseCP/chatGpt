JEHOVA-ELOHIM
O Everlasting God, El-Olam, who can compare with Thee? Who, O Lord God, is there named amongst all creation, amongst all mankind-yea, amongst all earthly and spiritual kingdoms, principalities, powers and authorities who can speak and by his breath, creation is?

Only Thee O God, THE I AM…

Who is like unto Thee, O God, EL-Elyon, The Lord God Most High? Who can by his unspoken will instruct each star, each planet – yea, all of the universes and the trillions of galaxies, to suspend themselves in the appropriate locus? Who is able to command them–and their order and their paths and their seasons of ingress and transit, are?

Only Thee O God, THE I AM…

El Shaddai, Almighty God, The Ancient of Days, who is able to sit above the circle of the earth and the beginning from the ending of each celestial orb, or by his hand stretch out the heavens as a curtain to spread its expanse over all creation as a tent? Who can by his word, cause the sun and the moon to stand still in their circuits, and by such, testify that he is The God, The El Shaddai, The Adonai? Only Thee O God, THE I AM…

IN THE BEGINNING,
IN THE BEGINNING,
IN THE BEGINNING,
GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE
EARTH
IT IS…
“By the Word of The Lord the heavens were made, and by the Breath of His Mouth all their host.” Psalm 33:6.

“You alone are The Lord. You have made the heavens, the heaven of heavens with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them and the heavenly host bows down before You.” Nehemiah 9:6.

“Lift up your eyes on high and see Who has created these stars. The One who leads forth their host by number, He calls them all by name, because of the Greatness of His Might and the Strength of His Power not one of them is missing.” Isaiah 40:26.
