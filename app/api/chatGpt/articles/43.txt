Pour Contempt on all my Pride – Attempts at Honesty

I have a theory as to why there is so much written about the Pharisees’ running battle with Jesus in the Gospel narratives.
One thing that comes through loud and clear in the recorded stories is that the Pharisees were motivated by pride in their position and pride in what their supposed superior righteousness.
The problem with pride is that it is so easy to spot in others and so difficult to identify in ourselves. We read about the pharisees and can easily point to their pride and error. Yet, we can be unaware of how pride is affecting our own behavior.
The irony in this is that it should be the other way round. We should be quick to identify it in ourselves and slow to accuse others of possessing it. We should know ourselves better than we know anyone else and be aware of our tendency toward pride.
Jesus word picture about removing the log in my own eye before seeking to fix the speck in my neighbor’s eye should guide us here. We need to check our sense of superiority before we seek to “help” our neighbor see his problem.
Back to my theory, I think the reason why there is so much about the Pharisees in the gospels is that we all have a tendency to be blind to our own falsly elevated opinion of our own behavior. I would go so far as to say that if you think you have avoided this trap, that is proof that you have fallen into it.
When friends and loved ones criticise me, I find that I want to defend myself rather than look for what is true in the criticism. Sure, there are times when the criticism is too harsh and not given in a spirit of love and grace. But even when the critic crosses over into injustice, I should still be willing to acknowledge what part of the criticism is justified and requires repentance.
Instead of getting defensive or ignoring the criticism, I should follow the example of Jesus as recorded by Peter:
“When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.” (1 Peter 2:23, ESV)
I should instead, entrust myself to God as the perfect judge in the knowledge that he will be both fair and gracious. This knowledge should put me in a position to be both honest about my own failing and gracious to my critic.
So, in a way, we should be grateful for the critics in our lives, even the ones that seem to be too quick to point out our faults. Because, like Paul’s thorn in the flesh, they will keep us from getting caught up in pride.
I am reminded of the first verse of Isaac Watts’ hymn, “When I survey the Wonderous Cross.”
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
Our critics point out our need to repent of our pride rather than defend it or strengthen it. Pride is a cancer that needs to be eliminated for our spiritual health. Our pride deserves our contempt, not our defense.
