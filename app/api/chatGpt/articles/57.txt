Chapter Ninety Five

When I married her son, Bernadean might have felt there were things about my life to concern her. She may have wondered if I was the best girl for him. Her perception was warranted, but we hadn’t had much time to get to know each other yet.
And that wouldn’t change because the mileage from their hometown to ours meant we didn’t see each other often.
Until we moved into their family room.
For about three months, we had nowhere to stay while we busily secured loans to buy a trailer home and land for our farm
I also began working in Bernadean’s Bible bookstore and saw firsthand her business savvy and hard work. I was determined to make a good impression and work hard too.
In life, we have so much to learn. Working alongside Bernadean, I realized how much I didn’t know. It was a humble place to be.
But Bernadean always gave me time to learn.
Maybe because she’d worked so hard for so long, she didn’t want to hurt others who were trying their best.
Once, when Bernadean was hospitalized during an especially painful episode with her multiple sclerosis, I sat with my father-in-law in the waiting room. All Bernadean wanted was to be able to get back home—and get back to the work she loved.
I asked him what gave Bernadean such strength to go on when she was so weak. 
He said, “She lives in God’s strength, not her own.”
At 95, Bernadean is still living in God’s strength, and I’m thankful she’s helped me learn  that and so much more.
