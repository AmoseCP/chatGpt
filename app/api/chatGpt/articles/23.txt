Bibi will not stand in the next election

All the polls are worthless
I’ve often written that political opinion polls in Israel are all worthless. Their predictions are always wrong. Their small sample size makes the margin of error so large that they lose all meaning. And none of them considers the obvious, that Bibi, after this term, will go on pension.
I was at an evening for English-speakers with Bibi before the last elections. We were first trained to chant “Four more years, four more years,” before Netanyahu entered. But then the chorus changed it to “Ten more years, ten more years.” Bibi said with a frown: ‘Four would be nice. Common.’
Bibi will appoint a successor—by then, the only Likud politician who hasn’t attacked him without apologizing. The Likud will win the next elections because Bibi brilliantly fought the wars on all fronts after the October 7 debacle, and more people woke up realizing that feeling nice about our ‘peace partners’ doesn’t mean they feel so nice toward us. And any personal animosity against Bibi will be gone from the playing field.
His image will be boosted when he’s acquitted in court of all charges and also in all inquiries into the Simchat Torah massacre. The only thing to be held against him is that he implemented the Israeli consensus that you can appease terrorists. Only Lieberman disagreed, but he was ‘an extremist.’
So, the next government will again be right-wing, ignoring poverty, and supporting the rich and powerful. It’s sad, but I blame it on our enemies.
So, beware that all the polls ‘predicting’ this, that, or the other ‘if elections were held today’ are baseless, worthless, and a waste of money and time.
