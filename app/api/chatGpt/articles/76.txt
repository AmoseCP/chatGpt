What pastors should wear while preaching (proper church dress code)

Between the 4th and 6th centuries, early Christian ministers adopted distinctive attire, setting them apart from the people they shepherded. As long robe-like garments of the Roman and Greek Empires became less popular in civil life, the church retained the attire for clergy, which evolved into what we know today as vestments.
In many Christian traditions, clergy still wear liturgical garments. As a low-church Baptist, I have limited knowledge about the use and symbolism of Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox, Methodist, and Episcopal vestments. However, in many of these churches, the expectations concerning clergy attire are clear. This article addresses the muddied perspectives of dress codes in Evangelical churches.
How a pastor dresses is ultimately much less important than teaching sound doctrine and caring for the congregation. But people do notice what you wear. I’m personally into watches and dress shoes. These two hobbies affect my fashion decisions; my church obviously sees these choices when I preach. My Saturday night routine involves polishing shoes and picking a matching watch strap. I tend to dress up more than down.
But a couple of questions come to mind regarding the unwritten dress code of pastors. Should pastors dress up on Sunday since they are leaders? Or should they try to blend in with the congregation and be more relatable?
Dress up or blend in? If you dress up, you tend to be more formal than the typical church member. Since I minister in Southwest Florida, flip-flops are standard church attire. My polished leather shoes and tailored sport jacket stand out as dressier than most. Some pastors dress similarly to the typical church member and are not easily identifiable unless on the stage or behind the pulpit. Why does it matter?
Dressing up signals discipline, preparedness, and respect. Blending in signals relatability and approachability. Neither approach is wrong, but you can’t be both simultaneously. In fact, I suspect most pastors are choosing their Sunday outfits more intuitively than strategically. Or they grew up a certain way and retained the habit. Even if you give almost no thought to how you look on Sunday morning, you still send signals by how you dress.
Age and personality play a role. I enjoy the details of craftsmanship. Omega’s co-axial escapement is one of the most significant advancements in watchmaking in the last 200 years. The Edward Green 888 last is the perfect blend of modern style and elegance — the finest of Northampton shoemaking. I enjoy wearing watches and dress shoes because they fit my personality. You should feel free to dress in a way that fits who you are.
Not only does personality affect style, but age does as well. There is a cringe factor when watching a pastor “try too hard” with fashion. The goal is often to appear far younger, but the attempt falls flat. Your wardrobe will naturally evolve with age — and perhaps your waistline. It’s ok to graduate from one style to the next as you get older.
Casual attire can be high status. Some sneakers are status symbols, much more so than bespoke oxfords. Forms of casual dress can be a sartorial flex. Just because you are wearing a hoodie and jeans does not mean you are dressing down to blend in, especially if the clothing articles are from limited production lines of desirable brands. Accessories such as fountain pens, briefcases, and even specific Bible editions can project high-status signals.
I have no problem with pastors making consumer choices. I am a free market capitalist, so if you want to spend money on an expensive fountain pen or a nice pair of sneakers, that’s your decision. You may intentionally spend less on a vehicle, for example, to spend more in another area. While I may spend more on a pair of dress shoes, someone who is an avid fly fisherman may pay the same amount for a top-of-the-line rod and reel.
Perhaps some of you believe this subject is trivial when considering the grand work of God’s Kingdom. You are correct. But pastors do receive a lot of comments (both positive and negative) about their wardrobe choices. So, be wise about how you dress, but don’t be overly consumed with fashion. You may choose to blend in to be more approachable. Or you may choose to dress up to signal respectability and discipline. I can’t imagine wearing a hoodie to preach (or vestments for that matter), but I think it’s great if you do.
