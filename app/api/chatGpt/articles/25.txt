America’s yearly ego show making fun of democracy

There is nothing funny about this grotesque hate and deception fest
I’m going to describe this as only someone can who doesn’t believe in the American nightmare and fairytale. Don’t read it if you can only take fake. This commentary and analysis will call a spade a spade and more.
I won’t say that MAGA fans are having second thoughts. If they had had any first thoughts, they would never have voted for this imposter.
It started with chanting, ‘U S A,’ emphasizing the dumb nationalism that it uses to have a strong, bullying military to have the world obey it. The proud ex-colony orders us all (nationalism, capitalism, and colonialism). They are unabashed about their dictatorship of the world and their equality to China and Russia, each with its own strongman and overblown army.
The first deceit was that the real wheelers and dealers, the architects of Project 2025 and the world’s wealthiest man, Elon Musk, did not speak.
The speaker was the top anti-democrat and top anti-republican (no capitals) in America’s short 250-year history. He’s a well-known immoral, hateful, power-hungry, dictatorial, paranoid, failed businessman and con artist. That did not stop anyone from applauding and smiling.
He spoke for almost two hours. Half of that time was spent on applause and ovations! The first standing ovation was for his trophy wife, mother of the successor to King Donald I of West Korea, King Baron I. Republicans who didn’t applaud will be dealt with as in other ‘people’s republics.’
When he said America, he meant I. L’état c’est moi; the State, that’s me.
He first bragged about his swift actions, that this term, he came well-prepared—see Project 2025, Trump’s Mein Kampf, he wrote nor read.
While his administration is ruining the economy, and the average American is poorer, hungrier, more powerless, and more scared than in decades, America’s top bully was bragging about the American dream and spirit. When you start with nationalism, the State takes precedence over the People, which is the American Constitution on its head.
Besides bragging about his success, he tried to portray that resistance is chanceless, that his growing dictatorship is unstoppable, which it isn’t.
There was some token protest against His Highness’ disregard for truth, facts, and the law, but the majority shouted that down as a clear sign that their version of ‘democracy’ is the dictatorship of the misled majority.
It was labeled ‘a disruption of the decorum,’ like King Hussein’s news readers would call demonstrations for food ‘harming the unity and peace.’
In German, Ordnung muß sein, there must be order [before anything]. In Hollywood, The show must go on. An elderly Black man was removed. Even the Hitler Olympic Games let Blacks participate to pretend democracy.
Brings to mind how the White-nationalist Trump Jugend stormed and vandalized that same room after Trump lost the 2020 election and got away with a presidential pardon by the agitator-in-chief.
Meanwhile, the high-salaried Democratic block did nothing—as it has been ‘doing’ ever since their monumental election loss. Highway robbery. Oh, I’m sorry, during applause, they held up signs reading, ‘false,’ ‘musk steals,’ (his other billionaire pawns don’t?), ‘save medicaid,’ ‘protect veterans,’ ‘That’s a lie!’ ‘This is Not Normal!’ and ‘Start by Paying your taxes!’ Many women wore pink in protest. One wore a black t-shirt with ‘Resist!’ on the back.
Then, Trump boasted about the racist gerrymandering paying off so well.
Then Trump praised his racist border control. Applause and cheers. His own ancestors fled Germany to the US to evade conscription. Yes, bone spurs seem to ‘run’ in the family. His once illegal immigrant wife applauded too.
From there, it was an easy step to ‘illegal immigrants.’ He didn’t know that ‘asylum’ meant refugees. He thought they were from mental institutions. But he liked his mistake so much, he kept it part of his mischaracterization.
Trump has no grace. So, again, he called Joe Biden ‘The worst president in American history,’ not realizing that makes his win a shoo-in. That’s because hatred is not an opinion; it’s an inability to think well.
Worse, the world’s most powerful marionette complained that nothing he could do for the betterment of humanity would please these (pointing) Democrats. He lied that it’s the fifth time like that, which is untrue. They often clapped during his previous addresses to Congress. But the spineless Republicans lack collegiality too and gave a standing ovation for that lie.
If you think Trump said something truthful, look into it. You’re mistaken.
Trump blamed the Democrats for dividing the nation because they refused to celebrate with him his tremendous ‘success.’
Greed personified, he declared a freeze on hiring civil servants (he’s firing them by the thousands as he will soon dump the Jews), a freeze on all federal regulations (that protect the public against abuse, fraud, hazardous work conditions, and pollution) and a freeze on all foreign aid (by which the US wields its power in other countries, including global health control—his reign killed 1 M Americans from Corona, and he was reelected!). He says he’s against fraud, but he just fired all the anti-fraud Inspector Generals.
He withdrew from climate protection because it’s too expensive. ‘The US overpaid.’ It’s also the biggest climate polluter. Profit over survival. Mind you, these profits won’t go to the public. They go to the richest of the rich.
‘To unshackle the economy’ (for the stock market, investors), he will take down ten regulations for every new one. Safety is too expensive.
To hurt single-parent families, he’ll fire home-based Federal workers.
He baselessly claimed the many court cases against him were instigated by Biden. He’ll make sure he’s immune from now on. Never mind that he means disempowering the legal system to violate the law with impunity.
With book banning on the rise, he ‘brought back Free Speech in America,’ which is code for hate speech. He even objects to Democrats disagreeing.
Making English the official language is because his racism makes him not understand any reporter with a ‘foreign’ accent. It’s more White racism.
He took down Federal minority discrimination protections (DEI). A global embarrassment of the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave. Minorities must do without protection to set off the -ism that hurts them. ‘From now on, hiring will be merit-based,’ said the mouth of a financially privileged, White male who became president with no qualifications.
Just like Hitler needed Antisemitism, Trump needs anti-trans sentiment. You’d ask, ‘What harm do such minorities do?’ It’s for fostering hatred only. Once (!) a transwoman won from a cis-woman by 5 minutes (not: hours).
Trump called his ideological bend ‘common sense.’ It’s rather normalcy that jives with sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, and xenophobia.
A special section is his ‘rescue’ of the common man struggling with poverty. He blamed his predecessor for the billionaires keeping the prices high and now hides that his tariffs are taxes and whimsical, crashing Wall Street.
His promise to lower prices ‘on day one’ became ‘I’m busy daily for this.’
Again, the prices of energy and gas will go down when we pollute more. He lied that America can get energy-independent. America can’t drill much more. And making oil companies rich doesn’t mean they’ll charge less.
He promised an ‘increased production of critical minerals and rare earth.’ Of course, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about since he doesn’t read or have the discipline to get informed. He’d rather wing it—and it shows. He meant ‘critical rare earth minerals,’ Lithium for Musk’s car batteries.
He claimed reducing government spending would curb inflation, which it won’t because the money won’t go to the population but to the billionaires. He bragged about racist cuts for things ‘nobody has ever heard of’—he means he never heard of it: sedentary [stationary] migrants, the African nation of ‘Losuto’ [sic; it’s called Lesotho], making fun of Stacey Abrams (she’s so well respected that the Republicans booed her). Further, cuts to ‘lavish fish monitoring,’ which is ‘larval fish monitoring,’ something ‘vaigan’ [sic], which probably means vegan, ‘making mice transgender (animals have no gender, only a sex), but it was a study on transgenic mice on cancer and asthma, and much more, that is too much for the greedy billionaires.
They found half a trillion dollars of ‘incompetence and fraud’ among payments to ‘our seniors whom we love and rely on.’ He meant, of course, that they rely on us, but he couldn’t say that. This ‘fraud’ is the excuse under which Musk will try to break down social security. Their greed knows no limit. Any cent paid to a vulnerable person is a cent too much. Payments to ‘millions’ of ‘people long dead’ are ‘hurting social security.’ Understand that people with incomplete data were given fictive birth dates, making clear they shouldn’t be paid as long as the data were not completed, but Trump and Musk ‘explained’ this as a fraud of paying people long dead.
‘Interest rates today took a beautiful drop.’ He didn’t let on that this threat of a recession comes from the financial world collapsing and investors shifting their money from (soon worthless) bonds to tangible real estate.
His ‘balance the Federal budget’ means that billionaires will continue to pay nothing and get another record-breaking tax break. What, he lied? The taxes of most people will skyrocket, and government spending to support the most vulnerable of them will be cut. All the misers cheered.
The Gold Card program is meant to entice rich people to buy themselves American citizenship ($5M), who will then ‘contribute to the economy and reduce debt.’ Of course, they won’t, because the rich don’t pay in the USA.
‘True democracy is to throw out the absurd regulations and bureaucracy.’ It means that entrepreneurs can do whatever they want, and workers and citizens won’t be protected any longer. Greed in full swing. Hurray! ‘We are draining the swamp from unelected bureaucrats.’ He didn’t mean Musk.
He again promised ‘tax cuts for everyone.’ In his previous term, these cuts for 99% profited the billionaires, raising the Federal debt for decades to come to be paid by the blue-collar workers. The rich cheered again.
He promised ‘No tax on tips’ (a gimmick), no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security. This should make the gifts to billionaires kosher, and it takes the place of forcing employers to hire more people instead of demanding overtime and instead of making the minimum hourly salary decent.
Car production (Musk) will be promoted because ‘this gives many jobs.’ Yet, roads and bridges are crumbling from neglect, public transportation is laughably poor, and pollution and obesity are killers like never before.
New factory owners will be tax-exempt, the fake trickle-down economy.
He must know putting up tariffs is just a consumer tax, and when countries buy or sell more to the US than in the reverse, no one is ripped off. He lied that US’s overspending is a ‘subsidy’ to the other countries. The Republican senators gave the lies a unanimous standing ovation—that’s complicity.
His excuse is that tariffs would force foreign investors to build plants in the US. But most won’t and will ignore the US market. They’ll sell more to the rest of the world that’s also no longer interested in the impoverished USA.
‘Our farmers will have a field day.’ He doesn’t know they have a field day every day? Trump ‘loves’ them. Many folded like Trump’s casinos (How do you bankrupt a casino?) from his previous tariffs, despite ‘special subsidies.’
His tariffs on steel must protect the American steelworker. Trump Tower in New York was built with Chinese steel. Need we say more?
He just admitted that, once the bill passes that makes it illegal to publish fake sexual pictures, he’s going to use it to ‘protect’ himself—he just can’t shut up. Until then, the Epstein papers will stay heavily redacted, obviously.
Ignoring that most immigrants, legal and illegal, are law-abiding and profiting the US economy, he blamed ‘unsafety’ for children and everyone on the long-refuted ‘stranger danger’ sentiment. Most sexual abuse comes from people you know, and the greatest terrorist sits in the White House.
‘We have to take care of our law enforcement,’ but he just gave a blanket pardon to the convicted cop killers of January 6, Nazis, and fascists alike.
Just like one (confused) person setting Berlin’s Reichstag on fire sufficed to start abusing all Jews and clamping down on democracy, one murder by an illegal alien is enough to go after all Spanish-speakers—mark my words.
The rhythmic applause to declaring America a White heaven matched the sound of marching soldiers shouting, ‘Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.’ Just my fantasy.
Applauding dozens of people in the gallery is great theatrics and buys into one of America’s greatest illnesses, personality cults on all levels of society. Moving stories of good and brave people who faced loss or death.
He blamed Canada for supplying the US with fentanyl. It’s likely the reverse.
He claimed that the US courts have been turned upside-down by radical left lunatics, pointing at the Democratic Senators. If one thing is upside-down, then it’s that statement. He has packed the corrupt Supreme Court with a bunch of Trump cronies, installed thousands of lower-level judges, and unleashed constant rhetoric against the Third Branch of Government.
He called ‘fair, equal, and impartial’ his unprecedented purge of the FBI, Pentagon, Inspector Generals, and anyone who could keep him in check. He’s ‘for’ the Constitution, for which he has more disdain than anyone.
Of course, he hailed police and firefighters who fell in the line of duty but said nothing about or against police brutality. Scientists tell us a mandatory death penalty for murdering a police officer won’t lead to fewer murders, but it will keep the State at the immoral level of murdering felons.
Autism has skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 36. His anti-science pawn is going to cure this. Yet, most non-autism is the handicap; autism is great.
His campaign against transgender has taken on preposterous proportions. Most transgenders never transition. Of those who do, 1% later regret that. That fraction of a fraction is now his excuse to go after the 99+%.
He wants the US to build a ‘Golden Dome’ against incoming missiles. It just got outdated on the Israeli battlefield by drones. No one needs to know. He also did not mention that it’s an Israeli invention. In fact, Israel and its need for the US as a powerful Ally were totally missing from the speech! It was negotiating with Chamas to get US hostages freed, and the Abraham Accords are for the US to transform the Middle East to the US’s taste!
He’ll give tax exemption to shipbuilders and ‘take back’ the Panama Canal.
With his usual creative bookkeeping, he’s explained that Europe paid too little and America too much to stop ‘the war in Ukraine.’ No condemnation of Russian aggression, of course, since we all know Trump is Putin’s poodle.
Trump said G^d saved him from imminent death to ‘Make America Great Again.’ Just like Hitler and Arafat felt G^d’s protective hand. He did not say this about the White House physicians who saved him from a COVID death.
The best follow-up is then that Americans are heroes (like Trump?), and for our Nation ‘we will fight for it till death.’ This sentiment Hitler needed from his troops and populace, and nothing has changed.
An appropriate moment to call only the Europeans ‘our ancestors’ who stole the land from the Natives they massacred but are not named by him.
He continued to falsify history, claiming Americans invented electricity, were the first who built successful aircraft, and invented industrialization. They alone defeated Communism, Marxism, and fascism all over the world. They used iron to build up the world. Yet, the Statue of Liberty was French.
Again, creating a free and prosperous country is not enough. It also must be ‘the most dominant.’ He really said that. Freedom built on the backs of others enslaved. The sky is the limit, and not even that, but healthcare for the poor is not important because they are a lost enterprise in his agenda.
Fittingly, he closed off with the Nazi dog whistle ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ which he first uttered when he survived the first assassination while raising his right hand repeatedly, lately in tone and gesture copied by Steve Bannon.
This was Make America Grotesque Again. So sad.
It Would Be Funny if it Weren’t so Sad
Fact-checking
Don’t just take my word for it
The New York Times compiled a very extensive fact-checking.
Politico’s list is also very wide-ranging.
FactCheck.org also did a very nice job with a rich overview.
The Associated Press seems to have focused on the (false) numbers.
The Washington Post fact-checked 26 suspect claims.
Pointer has a collection of many dozens so far.
Here’s Bernie’s reaction for anyone who needs his guidance.
This Opinion Poll Was from Before the Speech

You can fool some of the people all the time. You can fool all of the people some of the time. But you can’t fool all of the people all of the time.
