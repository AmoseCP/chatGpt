We want to take care of the people and communities we serve. Beyond donations, we create partnerships with organizations so that together we can contribute in a meaningful way and make a positive impact on the world.
A free ticket home for runaway kids
Our Home Free program, in partnership with the National Runaway Safeline, is the only national transportation and reunification program supporting at-risk-youth. We provide runaway, homeless, and exploited youth ages 12 to 21 with a free bus ticket to get to a parent, legal guardian, or alternative safe living arrangement.   
For more information, visit www.1800runaway.org or call toll-free 1-800-RUNAWAY (1-800-786-2929).
Lending a hand to travelers in need
We partner with Travelers Aid International to provide discounted bus tickets to travelers who need help completing their journey. Travelers Aid helps all kinds of travelers. This could be a vulnerable young person trying to get home, an elderly person who may have missed their bus, or just someone who’s down on their luck. Perhaps, even, someone escaping abuse (hint, hint).
You can find Travelers Aid staff and stations in some of the country’s busiest bus stations and transport hubs. For a list of locations, visit www.travelersaid.org.
Helping veterans get to hospitals
We have a lot of respect for our active and retired military personnel. So, if they need to travel to a Veterans Affairs hospital, we’ll give them a discounted bus ticket as part of the Veterans Transportation Program.
The Office of Veterans Affairs recognizes veterans who face challenges traveling to their Veterans Affairs health care appointments, whether that’s due to living in remote or rural areas, visual impairment, old age, disease, or disability. By providing discounted tickets, we’re able to help veterans across the country access the medical care they need at Veterans Affairs hospitals.
