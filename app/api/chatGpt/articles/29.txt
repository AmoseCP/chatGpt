Use the ‘clarity’ of Antisemites

We should learn boldness from the haters
The Dutch committee that yearly organizes the commemoration of WW II’s victims, and particularly the Holocaust, this year decided to have four singers on stage, three of whom have been virulently anti-Israel in the past year. Hating Israel after October 7, 2023 is like hating Jews in 1945. It’s like anti-feminists singing at International Women’s Day.
I think they should go further. They should have the famous singer who says, “Antisemitism is the only path to freedom.” That is such a great statement because it echoes “Arbeit macht frei.” No one would infuriate the Dutch more and decide to stand with the Jews.
Maybe the cherry on the cake could be Putin as speaker, emphasizing that Zelenskyy is a “traitor to the Jews and a pure Nazi.” The most hated man in the Netherlands today will make the commemoration focus on the present and hammer home to everyone that fascism and Jew-hatred today are still our enemies.
Perhaps they can find someone to declare that the best way to honor the fallen is by condemning ‘the Ukrainian and Israeli aggression.’
The Sages of the Talmud, in their Ethical Guide, ask, ‘Who is wise?’ You would expect the answer to be someone who knows a lot. Yet, they answer, ‘The one who learns from everyone.’ Much later, the counter question was asked, ‘What should we learn from wicked people?’ An answer is, ‘Their zeal to do evil. We should have the same enthusiasm when we do good.’
NB: Antisemitism is not an opinion; it’s a set of lies.
