Hell's Prophecy: The Second Death

Shortly after dedicating my life to God’s purpose, my mother passed away from cancer. She never spoke about God and did not know Jesus, and she could not receive the gift of eternal life. Her death drove me to search the Bible for answers about her fate. What I found was deeply troubling. On the surface, it seemed that she was condemned to eternal torment and misery.

           This idea of eternal fire was disturbing and shook my peace with God. The concept of Hell seemed to contradict Yahweh’s Amazing Grace strikingly. How could this God of Love condemn my mother to endless torture? How could the lover of my soul become a vengeful tyrant, inflicting eternal pain on the woman who gave me life? Would the same Jesus, who suffered so much on the cross, turn around and condemn others to endless torment? It just did not add up.

           The notion of eternal suffering felt so alien to me, so a few decades ago, seeking peace and clarity for my troubled mind, I started taking a deep look into the Scriptures to understand Hell. As I explored further, many straightforward statements about death and Hell did not make sense. It was like trying to make two plus two equal five. Something about the “eternal Hell” doctrine did not sit right with me.

           My deeper study revealed a different perspective than the popular view of God’s Judgment in Hell. The Bible speaks of an “end” to the wicked, confirming that evil would end just as it had a beginning. This realization comforted me and made me understand my Maker’s ultimate plan. I am relieved to know that my mother will not be eternally tortured, suffering endlessly in a sulfuric inferno under the rule of the devil. God forbid.   

I have read and examined the usual teachings about Hell. Recently, I delved into two books on the subject: the bestseller 23 Minutes in Hell and another called A Divine Revelation of Hell. Both authors share their personal experiences of being given guided tours of Hell, and I was astonished and shocked by the details of the creatures in Hell:

          “I will try to describe the looks of these evil beings. The one speaking was extensive, about the size of a full-grown grizzly bear, brown in color, with a head like a bat and eyes that were set very far back into a hairy face. Hairy arms fell to his sides, and fangs came out of the hair on his face. Another one was small like a monkey with very long   arms and hair all over his body. His face was tiny, and he had a pointed nose. I could see no eyes on him anywhere... The sight of these demons and evil spirits, and the terrible odor that came from them, made me sick to my stomach.”1

                                                                    - Mary Baxter 

          Like the author, many have depicted Hell in bizarre ways to instill fear and promote following Jesus. However, this approach raises a crucial question: Can one truly comprehend a loving, merciful, kind, and forgiving God if the choice is between eternal life and unending misery? This traditional theology, I believe, is deeply unsettling.

            One popular Bible teacher, the Bible Answer Man, claims that “without Hell, there can be no salvation.”2 But must there be a “Hell” to be saved? Does our salvation hinge on the fear of endless torture? Quite the contrary.

            Instead of believers facing the threat of “God’s Great Eternal Barbecue,” sharing the message of Jesus’s immense love in salvation makes much more sense. He gave His only Son to die for us. This approach is a much more powerful attraction. Love’s attraction will always surpass the fear of eternal punishment in motivating someone to respond.

        “To love a god that would send another to a place of endless anguish is akin to pretend loving the schoolyard bully to prevent personal abuse... No human in sane control of their thought processes would send others to eternal punishment for any crime. Nor would they stand idly by allowing it to happen without protest of some kind.” 3

                                                                   - David Nichols             

               The concept of eternal torment has turned many people against God. The big question they ask is: How can a loving God inflict eternal torture? The Bible teaches us to be merciful, love our enemies, and treat others as we would want to be treated. Didn’t Jesus (God with Us) embody these principles during His time on earth? So where does Hell fit into these eternal truths? Can Hell and eternal bliss co-exist? 

             The teaching of Hell has led to more skeptics than believers. Could our Merciful God actually be a maniacal monster, spewing out hate for eternity? This doctrine paints God as a sadist. Even the renowned C.S. Lewis acknowledged that the doctrine of Hell is:

“One of the chief grounds on which Christianity is attacked as barbarous and the goodness of God impugned.” 4

Such a harsh concept will naturally elicit a harsh response from most folks.

     Let us be clear: The prophecy of “Hell” warns us of an unstoppable fire. Yes – there is vengeance coming from God, and the wicked will face their reward. There will be no second chances, and everything hidden will be brought to light. Justice is on its way. However, the Divine Judge takes “no pleasure in the death of the wicked.”5 The Creator of love does not wish for anyone to perish.

             For those wrestling with the complex topic of Hell, this exegesis aims to demonstrate the harmony between God’s Love and His Righteous Judgment. The Bible’s teachings on mercy and fairness are perfectly balanced. I desire to reveal this worrisome topic's unfiltered biblical truth. In addition, I hope to comfort and liberate those who have struggled with the idea of an eternally angry God.

What is your perspective? Will the wicked be able to endure eternal torment? What exactly is the “Second Death,” and will it end the madness and hatred in the universe? Should evil be allowed to exist forever? If people are already suffering in Hell, why would God need to resurrect them for a future judgment? These critical questions deserve rational, thoughtful answers, and engaging with them can lead to a deeper understanding of our faith.

            Imagine a world where there is no more crying, pain, or sorrow. History has passed, and we have “a new heaven and a new earth” for the righteous to live in. No rapists, no thugs, no place for evil to continue. Doesn’t the idea of letting maniacs live forever seem unreasonable? For them, wouldn’t “Hell” be bliss?

             As you dig into this book, you will see that the modern notion of “Hell” is more myth than reality. This book will free many from the grip of fear. Discovering this truth will allow “perfect love to drive out fear” and dissolve the myth, bringing relief and comfort to those troubled by the concept of burning forever.

             May your love for God grow, and the contents of this book bring you more profound peace.
