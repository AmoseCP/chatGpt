You’d think the Six Day War was short? Look how fast Canada will defeat the US!

Trump’s first big international defeat for all to see
Trump let 25% US tariffs on imports from Canada take effect on Tuesday.
Trump went bankrupt many times. But lately, his business instinct seems to have nosedived. His paranoia is that all are out to take America for a free ride, while often they aren’t. Paranoia is a serious psychiatric illness.
Paranoia is the persistent but baseless impression that people are ‘out to get you’ or subject you to persistent, intrusive, and unwanted attention. This mistrust can hinder social functioning and close relationships.
Zelensky’s assertivity will pale in comparison to Canada’s trade war.
The US is isolating itself with these trade wars. But it’s not isolating Canada, which is already preparing to tighten its economic cooperation with the UK and is even considering applying for EU membership!
I’m just waiting for it to team up with Japan and Denmark and Greenland.
Not to speak of all the other trade wars he’s unleashing. The US economy will crash, inflation will skyrocket, and the rest of the world won’t be so bothered by it since Europe, Canada, China, and everyone else will rely more on each other and prosper. King Donald I of West Korea still thinks running the US economy is like running a casino—into the ground.
What a surprise that Trump’s total ruining of the US economy rather than founding fascism will be provoking an uprising of the American People.

Trump is selling the US to Russia so quickly
We all knew he was Putin’s poodle
A month ago, Trump said he would ‘force Putin’ to end the war.
These are the actions he’s already taken:
Dismantled cybersecurity against Russian attacks.
Dismantled cyberwar capabilities against Russia.
Dismantled task force that sanctions the Russian oligarchs.
Shut down the foreign influence task force.
Saying Zelensky started the war and is a dictator.
Stopped supporting Ukraine,’s defense against Russia’s war.
Stopped helping Ukraine restore its electric grid targeted by Russia.
Telling Ukraine that some of its territory should go to Russia.
Tariffs on almost all major countries but not Russia.
Russia offered Trump support against Canada’s counterattack.
Musk gave a Russian cybercriminal all US cybersecurity data.
Trump is dismantling (‘economizing’) the US military and CIA.
Security clearances are now given out without background checks.
Putin goes to talk to Iran for Trump.
Trump will withdraw from NATO, and they’ll be fine without him.
This list shows that the ‘blow-up’ in the Oval Office was just premeditated to ‘justify’ these pro-Putin measures, many taken already.
Putin starting to gobble up its neighbors (Ukraine first) is like Trump’s wanting to gobble up the US’s neighbors (Canada, Greenland, Panama, but sans Puerto Rico because it’s not Aryan). They are two peas in a pod.
