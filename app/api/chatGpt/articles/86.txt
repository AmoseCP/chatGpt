A Problem Is a Problem, Regardless of The Size

This is nothing but an opinionated article about one’s life struggles.

Comparison is inevitable for our species.

You could argue it is the main reason for progress as it only happens if you compare past results with future experiences.

But damn it sucks when it comes to comparing problems!

I wish we as humans learned to complain when our time comes and not when another complains to us about their own problems.

Seriously, do you really believe that comparing your undressed issues with my existing ones helps me in any way?

I do understand that this is the way some people show empathy, but not everyone accepts that kind of response as an acceptable one.

I’m not saying I don’t care about you or your problems.

But in the specific moment, I choose to open up about my struggle, I don’t want to feel undermined or ignored!

When people do this it feels like my problem is either inferior or nonexistent.

To be fair, I don’t care about your opinion. To me, it’s a problem and I don’t need you to try to convince me otherwise.

And full disclosure, I’ve been guilty of this in the past! Nowadays I just listen.

Could you please do the same without disregarding me or my struggles? Thank you.
