Fifty ways to tone it down

Even if you think our survival depends on you yelling and being heard
Despite popular media and activists’ claims to the contrary:
Our democracy is not on the verge of collapse
Israel is not divided or weak
Accusations don’t equal guilt
Netanyahu is not a convicted crook or criminal
Chareidi draft dodging does not endanger us
Disproportional is a fancy word for wrong
Not every dispute means one or two sides are crazy or evil
Almost every outrage can be taken with a ton of salt
Being angry doesn’t prove you’re right
The more you yell, the fewer hear you
Being treated unfairly does not justify being unfair
Admit that catastrophic conclusions are an illusory exaggeration
Disagreement and discussion are normal in the democratic process
While anger is better than depression, calm confidence is still better
Try to place yourself in the position of your opponents (empathy)
Facts over feelings, logic over fury
When many agree with you, you can still be wrong
Blaming is easy; jointly building a better future is much harder
If you can’t listen and only talk, you’re not building a great case
Labeling people is often a lazy, irresponsible demonization
Calling others evil and hating them doesn’t prove you’re good and loving
Evil doesn’t deserve a platform, but I bet not all your opponents are evil
Those wounded deserve sympathy but not automatic agreement
Aim at issues, not at people
Protests cannot replace democracy
People not getting along is not always a scandal
Anxious doesn’t mean (your) quick fixes must be executed right now
Crazy as it may sound, the others might be right too
You might be too angry to see a fuller, larger picture
Humbly stating the truth gets a better following than trying to incite
Generally, lying for a good cause is not a good thing
If any compromise or delay is out for you, you might be in the wrong
Being upset cannot erase the need to find logical arguments
This too will pass
Don’t hurt people
Just breathe
No setback proves that now, all is lost
Your children need you to calm down
Being powerful means projecting hope and confidence, not making noise
Being angry feels powerful and safe but makes others feel unsafe
Fight to strengthen the desirable more than to weaken the undesirable
Watching too much television drama is bad for your emotional health
Unfortunately, lying is part of politics and is done by almost everyone
The more you panic, the greater the chance a con artist will mislead you
Being drunk with anger may feel great to the mad but looks terrible to us
The most honest politician is really the best and biggest liar
Many look for a Jewish fall guy instead of being angry at the terrorists
Jewish infighting is letting the true enemies win
Having a punny slogan doesn’t mean you’re right
If it’s illegal, go to the police or court—don’t slander people
You should not break the law if there is no legal way to get what you want
Being long-term optimistic wins more allies than short-term pessimistic
Many are jealous of Bibi’s success, and it isn’t looking good on them
Bibi masterfully leads a war against many real enemies—be grateful
Don’t say about others what you don’t want others to say about you
NB: When you point a finger, three point at you, and one at Heaven (G^d).
