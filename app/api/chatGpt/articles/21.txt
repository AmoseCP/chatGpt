Is Trump holy?

Can a pig be kosher?
Oh, Gentiles can be holy too, but I wouldn’t say Trump is one of them.
Only Jews can be so naïve to think that a Gentile who smiles at them is their friend. I really got livid at an Orthodox rabbi suggesting that, for Jewish Law, Trump cannot be the messiah, but he could be his running mate.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it once more: Orthodox Rabbis are trained in honesty and, therefore, have no business dabbling in politics. He admits it himself, ‘It’s not always easy to tell good guys from bad guys.’ But he still finds himself competent enough to write a lengthy article, confusing others.
Trump is a failed businessman, only interested in money. There’s nothing holy about the guy. He just purged the military. He enacted racist executive actions. He goes after transgenders, the most vulnerable in society. He’s a convicted liar, rapist, and, clearly, a con artist. He wants to be king. He called Zelenskyy a dictator instead of Putin. He ‘prays’ as only atheists can.
G^d’s Seal is Truth, our Sages teach us. We must remove ourselves doubly from falsehood, the Torah tells us. How can an Orthodox Rabbis give the benefit of the doubt to a total swindler? How deep have we fallen!
Trump cuddling the Jews is just a setup to blame it all on the Jews, later.
Just in, Trump’s think tank, author of Project 2025, proposes to increase military aid to Israel to $4 billion annually from 2029 to 2032, and then, to decrease it by $250 million each year until it ends in 2047. The precedent for ending aid to Israel suffices. At a whim, it may be done at any time.
