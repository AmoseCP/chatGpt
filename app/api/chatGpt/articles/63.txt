State, Be Thou My God: The Cry of a god-less Citizenry

Michael Knowles recently went on Jubilee's 'Surrounded' series where he was debated by—or shall we say, insulted by—twenty self-proclaimed LGBTQ+ activists. The format of this debate is thus: the subject of the debate, in this case, Knowles, presents a prompt to his intellectual opponents who are then invited to rebut his claim until voted out by the majority. In this particular video, Knowles' first claim was "There is no such thing as same-sex marriage."
Unsurprisingly, the following dialogue was heated. Though he is a Catholic, Michael did not appeal to the authority of Scripture in passages like Genesis 2:_ and Matthew _:_. Rather, he chose to base his argument upon historical precedent and the Natural Law. By appealing to the natural order of the universe rather than distracting his largely atheistic audience with a scriptural citation, Michael was able to draw out the key distinction between him and his opponents; that is, their appeals to authority. Every claim, every country, and every culture makes an appeal to some authority (whether it be real or fictitious) to justify its existence, correctness, and perpetuation. The Romans sacrificed to idols because they believed in the authority of Mount Olympus; soldiers die willingly on the field of battle because they respect the authority of their commanding officer; children obey their parents because they understand their authority over them. Authority dictates reality—whether falsely or truly—for a person or people group.
Michael appealed to Christian tradition as his authority—though he did not cite scriptures in the discussion—if one was to drill down to the premise of his position, you would find it surely enough. The activists, on the other hand, cited the state as their ultimate authority. Perhaps the most clear example of this was in the first altercation: the fellow challenged Michael with the general question  "Do you admit that same-sex couples have been wed by law?" The by law clause here is telling. This individual seemed to be arguing that  "The government decreed same-sex marriage, and so same-sex marriage was." The implications of this line of argumentation are massive: for instance, if the government can degree reality, then the government is god. If the government is god, mankind ought to worship the government. Moreover, if the government can define marriage however it likes, it can define realities such as personhood however it pleases. 
Throughout the engagement, his claim was accused of lacking sufficient authority. The activists made the counter-claim that opinions, views, and practices have evolved throughout time, so "What makes marriage any different?"
Why does this YouTube video matter? Are these conversations worth considering at all? Why did Michael agree to engage with these activists? I aim to answer these questions by making the following observation: This silly spectacle brings into focus a key cultural and political distinction; the god of State will reign in the hearts of men when the God of the universe is rejected by the soul of a nation.
Questions like "Do you admit that same-sex couples have been wed by law," "How can you disagree with same-sex marriage when polls show the majority of American's are okay with it," and "What about the Mayans, you doofus" rang out during the contentious ___ minutes. Though they may seem random, or ridiculous in some cases, each of these rebuttals are predicated on a rejection of Michael's authority (Natural Law, historical precedent, and philosophical tradition) in favor of the authority of government. Each man seemed to say, "The government decreed, and so same-sex marriage was." Now, Michael's retort to this objection was simply that the government can degree any sort of silly thing but that does not make it true. To which his opponents cried "What is your authority?!" This vicious cycle continued on a tiring loop until time ran out.
Key observation: The god of State will reign in the hearts of men if the God of the universe is rejected in the soul of a nation.
