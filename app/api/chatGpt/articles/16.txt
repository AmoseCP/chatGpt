Trump’s failures so far

Calling his bluff works
He’s unleashed a torrent of actions to see which would pan out. Unfortunately, he doesn’t really care about any one of them. The success rate is meaningless to Trump. He just wants that, overall, the super-rich get richer and democracy is diminished until he’s instated as King Donald I.
Rebuilding Gaza
Since the Egyptian and Jordanian regimes financially depend on the US, Trump thought to invite the leaders and bully them into accepting the Gazans. Jordan’s King went and giggled. The Egyptian president simply canceled the visit and presented his own Gaza rebuild program. That should be financed by oil nations who’ll promise billions and give nothing.
Trade Wars
Canada, Mexico, Panama, Europe, Denmark, and China all fought back. Trump calculated how much they depend on the US but forgot that the US depends on them too. Big mistake. He’s losing each trade war he began.
Deportations and Travel Bans
Most of them will be blocked by judges. Trump still gains racism seeming strong and non-Whites getting scared, but White resistance is gaining.
A judge stopped Trump from deporting a foreign anti-Israel agitator. Left-wing Jews held mass demonstrations because singling out aliens is racist.
When Trump said he wants the judge who blocked his deportation order impeached, the Chief Justice declared that only appeals are open to him.
Birthright
Trump ordered citizenship by birth void for children of immigrants (Dreamers). The judge said, You can’t do that.
DOGE
Trump and Musk manage to sow a lot of chaos that must prepare for the demise of democracy and lay the groundwork for an absolute monarchy.
Yet, many of the grotesque measures strand in court and in the court of public opinion. His popularity is nosediving.
Judges reinstated tens of thousands of USAID workers fired indiscriminately and ordered to help them to be able to work as always.
Trump offered buyouts to all 2 M federal workers, which a judge blocked.
A judge ordered Trump to reinstate thousands of probationary workers laid off in a mass firing across 18 agencies.
Fired workers and their States are suing Trump for unlawful dismissals.
Meanwhile, the public is hitting Musk where it hurts most. Tesla stocks lost 50% of their value; no one wants to buy them or can even sell them.
NATO
Trump thought to help Putin by bullying NATO. NATO is not impressed. They say ‘your loss’ and do fine sans the US—just like the EU in general.
Ukraine
He would stop that war ‘on day one.’ Of course, he couldn’t. ‘I have a great relationship with Putin.’ If that were true, he didn’t have to be president to ask him to stop the war. To do so, Russia only needs to end its aggression. But Trump is Putin’s poodle, so Putin plays Trump, period.
Social Security
Presently, the outrage is too large for Trump to cut Social Security service.
Transgender
A judge voids random firing of transgender military personnel.
A judge stopped Trump’s order to halt transgender care in prisons.
DEI
An appeals court unanimously undid Trump’s firing of all minority and women leaders on a baseless claim they were all employed because of reverse discrimination. A chutzpah from a guy who never got any diploma.
A judge blocked Trump’s order to end federal support for DEI programs.
MABA
Make America Bigoted Again is whipping up a lot of grassroots opposition.
Assistance Freeze
A judge blocked a freeze on all federal aid meant for the underprivileged.
AI
Trump triumphantly announced data centers and an investment of $0.5T that would make the US the world leader in Artificial Intelligence (and espionage). Within a day, China proved it’s way ahead of the US. Total flop.
Inflation
Trump is getting rid of inflation, alright. The economy’s heading toward a recession. Thanks for the help. Not just has shopping not turned cheaper. Soon, the dollars to pay for it will be worth less. Watch his popularity dive. That’s not shooting someone in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Ave.
Revenge
A judge blocked Trump from targeting the law firm Perkins Coie.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats are trying to outdo the Republicans in their grand betrayal of the population’s needs. This is so far beyond my understanding. The Jewish Press suggests that a government shutdown would have been worse because then all federal payments would stop, and Trump could decide not to pay Social Security or any other vulnerable group. But could he? But John Stewart says it well:
Yet, I’m not into making people depressed. So, to lift your spirit and hope, consider Bernie 2028. Only, Israel needs to win all its wars before then.
