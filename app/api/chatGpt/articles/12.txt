On the art of staying empathetic to toddlers

Kelvin and Hobbes, ‘Mummy, Hobbes says you’re not my real mother.’ Mother: ‘Believe me, I am. If not, I would have strangled you years ago.’
Harvey Jackins, ‘Every parent of young children deserves ten sessions to murder their kids [outside of their earshot]. These are feelings to look at.’
Miriam Adahan, ‘It’s every child’s job to do exactly what irritates their parents most.’
Parental love and the kids’ cuteness are said to overcome all the anger we may feel toward young people, but that’s untrue. It is fully taboo to admit this, but the real miracle isn’t when caregivers abuse but when they don’t.
This doesn’t mean that toddler abuse should be looked at through pink glasses. Wanting to rob a bank is also natural for many people, but the second you start planning a heist, you’re way over what can be tolerated.
Instead of investigating ‘why’ caretakers abused, we should read more about those who don’t. How do they stay empathetic? What do they do with their feelings of being fed up? Do they have supportive supervision?
I had very high standards of how to take care of my little ones. I would let them cry whenever they needed while I held them and would not distract them. I knew that tears meant healing, not suffering. They always stopped by themselves and then were happy for a long time. How did I do that?
It should be noted that I became a father at 40 and then had already 15 years of intense therapy under my belt. And my parents had a very high morality. Under lesser conditions, it’s heroic any time you let your kids cry with you (not in a room alone where they’d drown in loneliness and the feeling no one cares). When you only sometimes let them cry, those times may be longer. But hey, do what you can and a little more, and then some.
By seeking tear tolerance, I learned that my parents didn’t have endless patience when I needed a cry. My mother’s ran out in about half a second. They were Holocaust survivors, so I don’t blame them (anymore). But this was my chance to have patience enter our family.
The problem with crying babies is that you can’t know how long they need. Five minutes, half an hour, or more than an hour? If found, a maximum of 75 minutes, but no cry has any guarantee. When they stopped, I was even brave enough to ask friendly, ‘Is that all?’ Almost always, the response was more crying. But they always stopped by themselves. What a relief!
When other babies cried in their presence, they wouldn’t chime in. They found it interesting or just continued playing. And they didn’t orchestrate ‘accidents’ to help grownups ‘understand’ when they needed to cry.
I remember this wonderful, warm, wise Mizrachi woman who cared for five kids daily and five times a week and gave them wonderful, freshly cooked meals. ‘I can’t have them cry,’ she said, ‘because when one begins, they all start.’ Not my son, does he? ‘No, he doesn’t.’ I understood her.
Babies still feel great about crying. (Don’t you remember?) When they hear crying, they assume it’s now safe to do so—if they need to. This ‘contagiousness’ many grownups still have with yawning.
My basic tool was that I myself had countless hours of shedding my own tears in therapy sessions. It was nice that, as a teenager, I had decided to be happy and not grow bitter, but to keep it up, the tears needed to go.
I had a triple strategy to give them space to cry as much as they needed:
1. At first, I warmly listened to them from the patience that came from my love for them. That lasted about 20 minutes.
2. Then, I pretended I still felt love and patience. The kids didn’t care. A smile and a really good copy of a smile were enough to help them drain their sadness. That too, I could keep up for some 20 minutes. And then?
3. I fantasized about what I soon was going to do to them. Sell them, and more bloody variations. Some 20 minutes of fury, revenge, resentment—they were all welcome. These would later help me in my therapy sessions.
When they still needed to cry after phase 3, I would give them to someone else or give up. I never had to do that, but it always was an option.
My kids became very happy, friendly, empathetic, and nice grownups.
When I was younger, I once was babysitting and got so frustrated with this one baby, I just couldn’t continue dressing him. But I knew babies are always happy to cooperate, so the trouble was with me. With my hands, I prevented him from rolling off the counter, turned my face away so he wouldn’t think it had anything to do with him, and simply cried for a couple of minutes. When I felt better, I turned to him to see how he was doing. He beamed at me like saying, ‘I didn’t know you too could do that’!
While love is natural, so is impatience in grownups. We need more inspiring stories on how to deal with our darker sides that surface when we need to be all loving and caring.
And professional caregivers should be taught what to do before they lose it. And they should be trusted on how personal they are with the kids (Do they change diapers as one peels potatoes or communicate with the kids meanwhile?) and not just on how much they smile to the parents.
Kindergartens with three caregivers with eight-hour shifts watching 30 kids borders on the criminal and theft. These are disasters in the making.
