Alexei Navalny was a Russian lawyer who opposed the corruption in the Russian government. He was arrested many times, had a toxic chemical sprayed in his face and nearly lost an eye, was poisoned by a military grade chemical, and spent the last 3 years of his life in jail, where he died in 2024. At the end of his life, Navalny stated the following:
“I have my country and my convictions. I don’t want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices. I know one thing for sure, I am among the happiest 1 percent of people on the planet – those who absolutely adore their work   I have enormous support from the people Maybe we won’t succeed but we have to try.”
Imagine a church where many lived their convictions and were wiling to put everything on the line. In this broadcast Mike discusses the example Alexei Navalny set for us, and more.
