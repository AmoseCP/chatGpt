The Mercy of God Alone - A Nighttime Prayer

“If I had not confessed the sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.” – Psalm 66:18 (NLT)

Please Pray:

Oh God, I always like to think I have things all figured out and don’t need to lean on You to lead and guide me. But I know that is not the way to live my life. Please forgive me. I need you there each and every waking hour. Please help me to understand that Your ways are the best ways and mine are not. I ask that you will guide me with your gentle loving hands and help me to make the right decisions based on what is best for me in Your eyes. I am lost without You. Thank you for never leaving me. In Jesus’ Name I pray, Amen.
