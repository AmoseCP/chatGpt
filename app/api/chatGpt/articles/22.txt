Correcting anti-Israel timeline falsifications

Time is an important fact often forged, as are cause and effect
Hasbarah: Stop reading if you don’t want to be confused with the facts.
The violent anti-Israel protests after the Simchat Torah massacre were not a reaction to Israel hitting back. Israel waited more than a week before the IDF was given the green light to start fighting Chamas. The massacre was a security mistake, and Israel was not going to compound it by walking into whatever traps Chamas set. No, the worldwide demonstrations were against the Jews. The demonstrators felt emboldened in their Jew-hatred.
Israel’s recapturing the West Bank was not the cause of Palestinian anger. The diehard Palestinian activists think of all of Israel as ‘occupied.’ When the West Bank was illegally taken over by Jordan, no one called it an occupation. But when Israel liberated this historically Jewish land, then the protest started. It was termed a violation of international law by the traditionally antisemitic Red Cross, and not by consensus of law experts.
The Two-State Solution and elevating Arafat from a terrorist to a politician was an invention of the naïve Israeli left, not a Palestinian idea. But Arafat stayed a terrorist, wanted all of it, and blamed Israel for opposing him.
Many international ‘pro-Palestinian’ activists and politicians were never interested in Palestinian freedom, democracy, human rights, or economic security and dignity, not even in Jordan. They were always just anti-Jewish.
Zionism is not a reaction to the Holocaust. It’s absolutely untrue that ‘the Muslims pay for what Christians in Europe did.’ In 1948, modern Zionism was already 50 years old. Without the Holocaust, six million more Jews could have moved to Israel. Israeli Muslims only ‘profited’ from the Shoah.
Zionism is not imperialist or colonialist. It’s the exact same as all the other decolonizations after WWII, when the natives threw out the occupiers.
Jews never tried to remove Muslims from the Holy Land. The secular Zionists offered a bi-national State. The Muslims were the ones refusing.
Islam came thousands of years after the start of Judaism. Adam, Moses, King David, and Jesus weren’t Muslims. That’s misappropriation and false.
Antisemitism is not a Christian invention. Some 1500 years before the start of Christianity, a monarch of Egypt already deemed Jews a dangerous minority that should be kept in check by mass murder recorded in the Torah.
