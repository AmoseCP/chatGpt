A Return to Blogging

I have been away from blogging for too long. My last post was in June 2024. This absence from blogging was due to my effort to finish writing my book on Old Testament women. The title of my new book is Ancient Israel’s Women of Faith: A Survey of the Heroines of the Old Testament. Kregel Academic will publish the book in August 2025.
I received a few messages from friends and readers asking me to blog again. Since the manuscript for my book has been submitted to Kegel, I believe it is time to blog again. There are many reasons why I blog about the Old Testament. The primary reason is that I enjoy teaching the Old Testament to individuals who may not be familiar with this part of the Bible.
I have been teaching the Old Testament for many years now. I taught Old Testament at Southwest Baptist University for 5 years and at Northern Baptist Seminary for 28 years. I have also taught Old Testament at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, at Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Kansas, and at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Moscow, Russia.
Blogging on Old Testament themes and topics is an excellent way to deepen one’s love and appreciation for this rich, complex, and often overlooked section of the Bible, which many Christians seldom read.
The Old Testament is a treasure trove of timeless wisdom, moral teachings, and profound spiritual truths. It addresses universal human experiences such as hope, suffering, redemption, justice, and more. Blogging enables these themes to be explored in ways that resonate with Christians everywhere, demonstrating how the Old Testament remains relevant in our day. Blogging about Old Testament stories helps people view the Old Testament not as distant or archaic, but as an enduring source of guidance and inspiration.
The Old Testament is sometimes misunderstood or perceived as difficult to comprehend due to its cultural context, symbolic language, and unusual narratives. Blogging on Old Testament issues offers me the opportunity to explain the historical, cultural, and theological nuances of the biblical text. Blogging about Old Testament stories and people allows me to help readers approach the biblical text with greater clarity. Breaking down complex passages or addressing common misconceptions about what the Old Testament says and teaches can facilitate deeper engagement with the text.
Many Christians view the Old Testament as merely a prelude to the New Testament, which can lead to its neglect. When I blog, I aim to demonstrate the deep interconnection between the Old Testament and the New Testament, specifically how themes, prophecies, and covenants in the Old Testament lay the groundwork for the life and teachings of Jesus. When we understand how God works through people and events, our understanding broadens, enriching our appreciation for the Old Testament and deepening our comprehension of the Bible as a unified story of redemption.
The Old Testament contains a wealth of fascinating yet lesser-known stories and figures that demonstrate remarkable faith, perseverance, or offer valuable moral lessons. As much as possible, I aim to shed light on these narratives, to clarify aspects and issues in the Old Testament that might otherwise go unnoticed by Christian readers.
Old Testament themes resonate across various faith traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, and among individuals who are not affiliated with a specific faith tradition. As a teacher, I strive to engage a diverse range of readers by exploring the lives of Old Testament men and women, and by focusing on topics such as covenant, violence, love, justice, and the human condition. This approach broadens the impact of each post, inviting readers to engage in dialogue where they can ask questions and contribute to the conversation.
My goal as a blogger is to make the Old Testament more accessible to a general audience by providing both short and longer posts, featuring engaging content that encourages deeper study. After reading one of my posts, I hope readers will open their Bible and explore a particular passage, theme, or story in more detail. Thoughtful reflections, practical applications, and devotional insights can nurture personal growth and spiritual development.
The Old Testament is not only a religious text but also a cornerstone of cultural and literary heritage. In the digital age, people often seek knowledge and inspiration online. Through my posts, I aim to provide a way to connect with readers where they are, presenting Old Testament themes in formats that are relatable and engaging.
In essence, my goal as a teacher and as a blogger is to foster a more profound love for the Old Testament, to encourage reflection, and to open the door for new perspectives, ensuring that the richness of these sacred texts continues to inspire and guide those who take the time to read and dialogue with my posts.
