Jesus' Triumphant Entry into Jerusalem a 'Powerful' Moment for 'The Chosen's' Tabish and Patel

In a phased three-part release, Season 5 of The Chosen is available now in theaters in the United States and Canada with Part 1 currently showing. The season will then be available to stream on Amazon Prime Video starting in June.
We recently sat down with ‘The Chosen’ actors Elizabeth Tabish and Paras Patel at the Adolphus Hotel, Dallas, Texas, to share the indelibly powerful emotions they felt as the scene for  Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday) was filmed for Season 5.
