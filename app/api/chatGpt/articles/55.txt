Trading Worry for Prayer and Peace

Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:6-7
I have been known to ruminate on my concerns far more than pray about them. I know firsthand what it feels like to invite my worries in and ask them to sit down with me. I let my worst fears play out—positive I can figure something out by doing this— and before I know it, I've given this worry the space and room to stretch out and make itself a certainty over God's truth.
Can you relate to allowing your fears to dance in your mind? Is worry your constant companion instead of prayer?
If most of us were honest, we would confess that we often choose anxiety over prayer. We may call it concerned, troubled, unsettled, bothered, apprehensive, or any host of less convicting synonyms. But the fact remains that we're worrying, no matter how we spin the verbiage.
This world gives us plenty to worry about—there's certainly no doubt about that. We feel out of control because we are not in control of much. But, friend, we must remember we have a choice regarding the care we carry. Rather than fretting over what we can't control, we must take it to the One who controls everything.
I know the feeling of allowing the worries of my heart to make me so unsettled I tumble over into the point of anxiousness and panic. You and I are certainly not alone in this. There is an apparent reason behind the Scripture's consistent instruction to pray instead of being afraid or worrying; we all do it.
Paul's warning in Philippians to pray instead of being anxious is one we must practice daily. Praying doesn't come naturally to humans—worrying does. Because of this, we must practice giving our cares and concerns—even the smallest ones—daily to our loving Father.
When we actively take our worries to God, we have His promise that, in exchange, we will have His perfect peace.
We are not exempt from the trials and tribulations of this world—period. But thankfully, we have a God who knows our sufferings and does not leave us alone. We have a powerful tool in prayer to move mountains, even the mountains in your head.
Remember this truth the next time worries and anxieties threaten to take away your peace.
Questions for Reflection:
1. Do you often worry? Is this a struggle for you? What are the three things this scripture tells us to do instead?
2. How can you actively take your concerns to your Father rather than dwell on them?
3. Do you have a worry plan in place? If not, take this time to plan for when worries threaten you. Memorize Philippians 4:6-7 and other scriptures to help you battle against the temptation to worry instead of pray. (See also 2 Corinthians 10:5)
Prayer
Father, thank you for sending your son, Jesus, to save me from myself. I am so thankful that He knows what it feels like to be human and to struggle with worry and fear. I am so grateful that He showed us how to pray and reminded us that we are never alone. Help me remember I can always come to you when the troubles of this world tempt me to worry. Help me, Lord, to make prayer a daily habit. In Jesus' name, I pray, Amen.
