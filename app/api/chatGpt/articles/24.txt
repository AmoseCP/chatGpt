An important announcement from the rabbi of our synagogue!

Feel free to use this joke for your favorite synagogue too.
Dear congregants!!
We must ask you to guard yourselves a little bit in the coming time for the congregation’s well-being.
We need to ask everyone who wants to be at our synagogue for a service that lasts more than 90 minutes to refrain 2 days beforehand (48 hours) from eating meat, fish, milk products, eggs, and any other animal protein. Otherwise, the smell in the small temple is unbearable, especially for the next minyan. We exempt the babies who only drink mother’s milk, since their bowel movements and flatulations don’t smell.
What a good grace from G^d that so many recently have had a stuffed nose, but spring is coming, and more people will be smelling right again.
For those who must eat animal produce on a physician’s recommendation or who accidentally ate non-vegan, the sextons will set up the hall downstairs for prayers, together with a chazan who has a cold or also ate non-vegan.
May those who add extra parsley, coriander, fennel, and kohlrabi to their diet be extra blessed for this important commandment between humans and their fellows. Please instruct the one who cooks the meals in your household.
This new policy we will begin on the first evening of Purim, so please refrain from animal protein from Tuesday evening. Thank you. This should have an easy start since, the day before the Purim reading, we all fast anyway, this year. May G^d bless you with all the blessings you need fulfilled and with a long and healthy life.
Since vegan foods are much cheaper, we ask the dear congregants to donate the difference in the price of the meals to the synagogue’s charity fund or give it to the sextons.
We also want to ask the congregation to pray for the healing of any habitually sour-faced Jew against the idea that when we enter Adar, we enlarge our joy.
May we all have an unforgettable, healing Purim!
