Stay honest, especially when fighting con artists

Honesty is still the gold standard
I remember when Russia invaded Ukraine against international law and promises. So, it was clear who was the villain. Yet, Zelenskyy immediately started accusing Russia and included lies. The press and politicians were shocked. These were the good guys! From then on, every accusation against Russia had to be checked first for accuracy. Such a waste of time!
Trump started by claiming Clinton was physically a goner. She was too weak to stand, etc. But by now, the Internet is rife with supposedly left-wing vloggers telling us for eight years already that Trump is demented, incontinent, and almost dead. He’s obviously not. I listened to a whole election rally by him. This guy is fit. Maybe on amphetamines and bronzer, but he launched sex lies per minute for 90 minutes. That’s not being senile. But the left-wing media lift out two mispronunciations of words and then say: You see. That diminishes the real danger he is.
Without lies, there’s no Antisemitism. The hatred has no factual basis. It’s an opinion based on sentiments and stereotypes. But in hasbara, it’s vital not to tell even one shortcut to reality. If we lie too, the listener won’t know whom to believe if he has no working intuition or common sense.
Don’t do any of the ‘But they lie worse.’ It’s too costly.
