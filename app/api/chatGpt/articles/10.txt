No civil war in Israel

Ignore the extreme left’s provocations
I must admit that, generally, I no longer get annoyed by lies in politics. It’s part of the political landscape all over the world, and you can’t follow and try to influence politics if you’re too sensitive about integrity. That is just as you can’t check butchers if you can’t stand blood.
However, I am disgusted by this harping by the extreme left on the danger of a civil war in Israel. They are almost the only ones talking divisively.
As a moderate left-wing extremist, I object to the fundamentalist, hateful, loud, know-it-all, ultra-left activists who spoil the good name of the left.
They command a lot of media attention. They make many people worried. And it’s all fairy tales, hot air, publicity-seeking, and stress-for-nothing.
They also hijack the moderate push against a government weakening of the judicial branch. They are the loudest but only a fringe group.
Ignore them. If they’re hurting because of the war, give them empathy for their suffering, but disregard their attacks on everyone else.
Often, they follow frustrated wannabe and ex-leaders hating the successful politicians, on the face of it, from jealousy and resentment.
One Likud Member of Knesset called for a war against the extreme left and called that a ‘civil war,’ implicitly admitting it’s a wish in vain, as Bibi says.
There are all kinds of smart guys who don’t know what civil war means. It means that two or more parts of the population will try to kill each other. It does not mean the population or judiciary resisting the government.
I do not appreciate the whole left crying wolf over a new law that is the exact compromise our President Herzog suggested. It could be a first step toward a broader judicial demolition, but in itself, it’s nothing dramatic.
There’s a place for anger. There’s a place for frustration. There’s a place for distress. There’s a place for criticism. But our strength is never in blaming.
In return, blaming the tiny left-wing fringe elite doesn’t help either.
Blaming is easy, but so destructive. I never read any of it. That includes all right-wing extremist provocation, which saves much time and aggravation.
In the Haggadah, the bad and the good child are mentioned together. That is because the distance between them is small. It’s a tiny but decisive step from blaming and guilting to taking responsibility and being constructive.
The media should give more space to ideas and plans and less to grudges.
A lack of intimate knowledge (and an absence of knowing of that lack of knowledge) helps the extreme left sow a lot of confusion in the Diaspora.
