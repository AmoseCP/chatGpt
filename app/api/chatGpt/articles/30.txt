Liberation audacity levels

Every level is important
Better than knowledge is awareness.
Some Introductory Comments
Oppression is the one-way undeserved mistreatment of group members.
Two groups are systematically mislabeled as oppressors instead of oppressed too, Jews and working-class men. (Jews are held hostage by the owning class to do their work. Men are not oppressed as men, but working-class men, Jewish men, Black men, etc., they are.) In a classical divide and conquer game, Trump plays these two and the rest against each other.
Most people belong to several oppressed groups.
All people are members of oppressor groups, where people are trained to be oppressive. Individually and collectively, such people can decide to work together as allies to oppose, hinder, and uproot the oppressions, one by one and all of them. It’s an art, and it takes time to unlearn oppressive conditioning. Taking over is oppressive. Yet, an ally can stop infighting.
Chutzpah Level 1: Sadness
I’m nothing less than everyone else. When I’m hurting, I’m allowed to cry and expect empathy. I suffer. It takes guts to say so in a hostile environment and among fellow oppressed who are still in denial. Still, typically, when we say we suffer, people are inclined to empathize.
It takes more mistreatment to condition people to be in the oppressor role. Yet, oppressed means being attacked non-stop and sometimes dying early.
Chutzpah Level 2: Anger
Better angry than depressed. Being ‘reasonable’ is for later. Under galling conditions, rage is reasonable. No, we’re not crazy; we’re furious.
Chutzpa Level 3: Unite
Don’t stay alone. Adopting an identity means creating a home. It’s difficult not to blame yourself (a bit) until you see others having the same struggles.
Try to be an ally to fellows whom you learned to disrespect via other oppressions. Try not to compete or infight and stop others from doing so.
Chutzpa Level 4: We Demand
The feeling of powerlessness is fake. From victimhood to leadership for a better world. Includes winning and maintaining a body of allies.
Chutzpa Level 5: Be Happy
Pride, optimism, hope, and trust, and it will get better. Celebrate now.
Chutzpa Level 6: Self-Confidence
We’re winning, and any opponents will lose. It may take years and decades, but we will win. No mightier an enemy than an idea whose time has come.
Chutzpa Level 7: Spreading Truth
Speaking truth to power. Every oppression is based on lies. Spreading the facts shows the virtuality of the oppression and will awaken allies. The oppression is artificial and fake—and coming to an end.
