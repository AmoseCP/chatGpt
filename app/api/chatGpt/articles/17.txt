Trump’s travel ban is to protect the US and Putin!

Ukraine is not on the list but Russia is
Some countries are targeted because they have a radical Muslim regime, some because they lie in Black Afrika, some because they are poor.
He never made it a secret he wants White, rich, non-Muslim immigrants.
But why would Trump send back people coming from Russia? Very simple. If they are opposition members, LGBTQ+, or draft dodgers fleeing the Putin junta, they should be returned. Putin would ‘love’ to deal with them.
That’s they only reason possible why Trump would ban people seeking asylum from Russia. He’s Putin’s poodle alright.
It’s a human rights scandal that must be exposed and resisted now.
