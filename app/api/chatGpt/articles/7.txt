Need we condemn, scare, shame, and hate outwardly religious Jews who fake it?

Are they faking being Orthodox or just weak?First of all, dishonesty is as antithetical as anything to Judaism. The Sages of the Talmud show absolute integrity. The Torah instructs us to go for truth as nothing else. So much so, that I regard dishonesty among Jews to must have come from assimilation into other cultures. (Antisemites calling Jews dishonest doesn’t help either. Just like any negative stereotype for any oppressed group, some may actually believe the insult, like calling people stupid doesn’t encourage most of them to use their brains.)Once, I asked the much-respected late Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, Rabbi Meir Just of blessed memory, how religious Jews could steal. Do they not believe G^d is watching?His answer was enlightening. I take it very seriously because of how pious he was. He said, ‘They believe, but when it comes to ownership, a blur [‘waas’] comes before their eyes so that they don’t see as sharp anymore.The Talmud already says that sinning happens only in a mood of folly. Had you thought a moment about this sinning, you would not have done it. In other words, there are evil deeds, not evil people. Reb Shlomo Carlebach never talked about sins. He called them mistakes.Recently, I read a column by a religious Jew, full of hatred of fakes. They pray three times a day in a synagogue but steal, break Shabbat, insult, lie, bully, abuse, or hate, all behind closed doors.We’re not discussing presenting ourselves a little better than we are. This is not uncommon. Look at the Sage who said, ‘If only our fear of G^d were as large as our fear of what others might think of us.’ We’re also not talking of those hiding they don’t belief anymore without hurting others. No, we’re discussing exceptionally big fakers, hypocrites, or con artists.I can understand her resentment if she or the people she cares about recently got duped by such fellow Jews.Yet, apart from empathy and therapy for victims and bystanders, we need to understand that such abusers are still considered Jews and not fully lost.Scaring or shaming them won’t help. Yes, it’s frustrating!As far as they violated laws, justice should be their fate.But for the rest, a wise, soft-spoken, non-threatening therapist should ask them how they got a tiny bit lost. What happened to you?Be prepared for lie after lie, and sob story after sob story in which they were victimized, true or not.They can cry a bucket about their made-up stories.You can only hope that one day, they’ll come clean.Don’t hold your breath, or wait for them. Don’t make them the treasurer of your organization. Don’t recommend them for their stellar character. Don’t marry them! Don’t make them your business partner.But also, don’t give up on them. As Reb Shlomo Carlebach famously said, ‘You never know.’ Let people surprise you. But don’t build on it.Remember they must have been terribly crushed when they were tiny and powerless. They don’t only play the victim. They once were and still feel like that. It doesn’t justify their abuse, but it helps us to understand them.When you feel beleaguered all your life, it seems the only way to live is to close your heart and give out no personal information. Not only are they untrustworthy. They’re terribly lonely and live in a hell of constantly not trusting anyone, even G^d. Where was He when they were stepped on?That’s why normal therapy doesn’t work for them.Don’t trust a word they say. Don’t make yourself dependent on them. Stay away from them so that they can’t abuse you. Save innocent people trapped by them, if you can without being hurt. Still, don’t say they’re lost.G^d considers how we feel when we sin when He weighs punishments.Let’s not sit on G^d’s throne and judge others. Hatred, in the end, hurts the hater the most. However, if someone just now hurt you, it might be inevitable to hate, and it may take time to return to yourself.When they tell you they have repented, don’t trust them. If you would, you might abandon them to their habit of cheating. Let their consistent deeds prove or disprove their words. If you don’t, you’re a fool.But never give up on such a person. We are in no position to do that.I met a couple of them. It’s the hardest when they abuse their power and receive great honors everywhere for their great work and person. But consider yourself lucky that you have your challenge and not have theirs.
