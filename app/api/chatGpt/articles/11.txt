Essentials like law, religion, food, and sex may reflect their highest goal or not

Sharing my opinion in the hope of clearing up some confusion
The highest goal of food is to give nutrition and just about the required amount of fuel and fluid to the body. However, this backfires with eating and drinking just for fun or to block bad feelings, especially with junk food.
Instead, after some initial good feelings, your health will suffer.
The highest goal of sex is to give you closeness and end your loneliness forever. However, this backfires with sexuality just for fun or to block bad feelings, especially without a partner you want to be with forever.
Instead, after some initial good feelings, you will feel lonelier.
The highest goal of religion and principled outlooks on life is to help us be as moral as possible. However, this backfires with worldviews that protect the strong and normal and ignore evil and hurt. Holy is not always pure.
Instead, after some initial good feelings, ideas may harm more than heal.
The highest goal of the law is to make life fair and just. However, this backfires with laws that protect the strong and normal and ignore justice and what’s humane. Legal is not always just; unlawful is not always bad.
Instead, after some initial good feelings, society will be more unfair.
On the latter point, hiding Jews in Nazi Germany was illegal but just. Hungry people stealing food is illegal but humane. Blocking Trans athletes in Trump’s US will soon be legal but unjust. The Israeli High Court that blocks the Israeli government may be undemocratic but just and fair.
Don’t use ‘legal,’ ‘democratic,’ ‘fun,’ or ‘holy’ as something automatically good, or ‘illegal,’ ‘undemocratic,’ ‘difficult,’ or ‘usual’ as automatically bad.
Illegal may be good when the law is unfair. Idealistic may be bad when the principles do harm. Fun is bad when it harms. Democratic may be bad if it is over-permissive of harm to oneself, others, society, or the environment.
Evil is when overall hurt increases. That should be the guiding principle.
