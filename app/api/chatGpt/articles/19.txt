Sexuality (un)related to gender and biological sex

The curse of good looks?
This post discusses the psychology of intimacy, not sexuality itself. For those nervous about my generalizations, it has a happy ending below.
Terminology: I call sexual preference the gender that you may deeply connect to through sex and not the genders you (want to) have sex with.
It is established science that, statistically, heterosexual women in their younger years prefer good-looking, rougher men. Still, when they decide to settle down, they’d favor men looking less sexy and sweeter because they’d be more faithful. I don’t use ‘faithful’ as a societal or religious norm or ideal but as one being most satisfying, psychologically. This predilection may be rooted in biology since two parents were often better for survival.
This seems also true for (MTF) transgender women (whether heterosexual or lesbian), even without hormonal changes. They too, with their cisgender sisters, generally seem to prefer character over looks in their partners. They seem to say about a partner with not the hottest looks in their book, ‘I can make this work; to hell with perfectionism or eye candy.’
But it seems that most men prefer their favorite looks in their sex partners above anything else. This seems true for cisgender heterosexual men, cisgender gay men (whether they seem more masculine or feminine), and transgender men on testosterone. ‘First sex, then we’ll talk (maybe).’
It seems the hardest to settle down and be faithful to men and women considered in their culture to be beautiful. Many of them seem to be without a partner later in life. This could be because they never united with one person and/or at the end of their days, their ego is too big for them to share their lives. Men insecure about their looks might get easily stuck in chasing new sexual partners in the hope of ever feeling beautiful.
Men, in general, are more visual than women; women rely more on sound. He should have a nice voice and make me laugh, though they’re not blind.
Perhaps those not having a physical type in (wo)men might be seeking sex outside of their sexual orientation. Then, everyone might look equally hot.
Good looks also attract people to become platonic friends. Yet regarding that, a good character seems the most important quality for everyone.
Labels and identities can give people a home. Generalizations and meeting kindred spirits can reduce self-blame and shame. But at the end of the day, each person is an individual, entitled to be an exception and unique.
