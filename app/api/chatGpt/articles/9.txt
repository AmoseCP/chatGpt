From green light to red tape, liberties may be immoral

Against popular misunderstanding
There is an objective norm for evil. Evil is what enlarges the total hurt.
Fortunately for moralists, that leaves a lot of space to argue gray states, but let it be clear that it is untrue that absolute evil does not exist.
Green Light
Many think a green traffic light means, ‘You can enter the crossing.’
Yet it really means, ‘You can enter if no other traffic is there.’ You can’t say, ‘Your honor, I had a green light, so I was allowed to ram them.’
Majority Rule
Many think that in a democracy, the honestly elected majority decides.
Yet, democracy means that the majority decides while taking all minorities into account. You can’t say, ‘We voted and decided to kill all people over six feet.’ A constitution and courts must guard the rights of minorities.
Free Speech
Many think free speech means that everyone can say whatever they want.
Yet, Free Speech is part of democracy. That means it should be reserved for everyone who abides by equality and equal representation. So, it is fully democratic to block racist, sexist, antisemitic, or fascist speech or representation. If it scares or hurts certain groups, it should be stopped.
Yes, I Can
Freedom of movement is important. Clinton, asked why he had an affair, said, ‘Because I could.’
Yet, when it would hurt us or others, restrictions are in order, by our willpower or by others against our own rash will. That’s not against our autonomy. Like, sexual abuse is abuse and not sex; free to harm isn’t freedom but harming.
Red Tape
You would think fewer rules and regulations help change and progress.
That depends. Cumbersome protocols may be desirable when they protect the socially weak like poor people, animals, or the environment or fundamental principles like honesty against greed, abuse, and egotism.

Laws and courts that don’t reflect this must be upgraded.
