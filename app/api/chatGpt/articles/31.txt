Kleptocracy, the thief who called the police is still not an honest person

King Donald I of West Korea
Many make the mistake of thinking that a thief who called the police must be an honest person.
Comedians take reality and put it upside-down to make people laugh. Trump takes reality, puts it upside-down, and sells it as reality.
Someone called out money streams to terrorists as ‘not just fraud, waste, or abuse. It’s a threat to American national security.’ That may well be, but the whole Trump junta is a threat to American national security.
DOGE is meant to cut down billions of governmental waste. What’s not in the news is that many of the cuts further threaten the financial and other security of Americans and non-Americans alike, while the harvest won’t go into the pockets of the common human but into the billionaires’ coffers.
Trump wants an end to the bloodbath of the Russia-Ukraine War. That sounds very humane but what he wants is what Putin wants. He’s been his poodle for a long time already. He just desires Zelenskyy to roll over.
Trump supports Israel in whatever it wants. What the news doesn’t say enough is that Trump supports the home-grown Nazis. Jews in the US are not feeling safer at all with the rise of racist rule (ICE) and xenophobia. Trump’s support for Israel and Jewish students doesn’t mean he’s pro-Jewish. He’s just using the Jews until he’ll throw us under the bus too.
To not be a pawn in Trump’s assault on the People, you only need to use your ‘common sense’ or ask your local trade union leader’s opinion.
The EU rightly says the free world needs new leader. The coming time will be L’État, c’est Moi (Louis XIV – The State, that’s Me) vs. We, the People.
