Stop persistent mistakes when fighting Jew hatred

You can’t make the same mistakes and expect a better outcome
Let’s go over some of the most ‘popular’ mistakes and misconceptions that happen on the way to free the world of Jew-hatred.
Jew-hatred is an opinion we must honor
Jew-hatred, like all oppressions, is rooted in lies. A tolerant person does not need to tolerate lies. There is not a kernel of truth underlying the oldest hatred. Jews are hated ‘because they are leeches sucking us poor’ and ‘because they’re the uneducated masses that drag us down.’ How can Jews both be the bankers and powerful and the Communists and Marxists? Jews are hated ‘because they are deeply immoral beings’ and ‘because they invented an impossibly high morality to make everyone feel guilty.’ Etc. In an epoch of heightened dishonesty, Jew-hatred gains more ‘legitimacy.’
Jew-hatred is deeply rooted
In almost all people, Jew-hatred is a superficial sentiment. Standing up against rabid Jew-haters is not to change their minds but to help the bystanders move away from the foul nonsense.
Change Jews to stop Jew-hatred
Fortunately, or unfortunately, Jew-hatred is not caused by Jews. It’s based on slandering Jews, but even if all Jews were to move away or turn into total Angels, Jew-hatred would continue with the same force. Since it’s lie-based, better facts won’t make it disappear. Jews trying to change (blame) Jews might be just infighting that all oppressed groups do and should ban.
All Jew-hatred is pro-Holocaust and pro-genocide
Just like not all sexism or racism is rape or murder, most everyday-life Jew-hatred is mild. Yet, it creates a culture that may feed and empower groups of people to seek to ‘exterminate the Jews.’ For instance, it leads to making terrorists’ propaganda believable over simple information from Israel.
The left hates Jews more
If we consider extremists, the extreme left and the extreme right are equally deadly for Jews. Still, political affiliation plays a major role. The right tends to use Jews for their classist plunder of the population, and when the latter revolts, they blame the Jews. The right can do this when the left and the working class don’t stand with the Jews as solid allies. Naturally and traditionally, Jews will stand with the disempowered. So, when you see Jews who don’t, resist their reactionary words and actions, but make clear you understand they are held hostage by the right because of the left.
The fight is eternal or even futile
Who says Jew-hatred will never stop? Diehard Jew-haters believe Jews will go extinct because of their actions and soon, even when the physician shakes his head and pulls a sheet over their heads. But they are proven wrong, generation after generation, against all odds. But those who say this societal illness is incurable are wrong, too. Smallpox was eradicated. Only, it’s silly to believe that Jew-hatred will stop while other oppressions go on unhindered. Sexism, racism, adultism, classism, able-bodyism, and all forms of bigotry and supremacy need to go, too. It’s a package deal.
Jews and Israel must lead the fight
Gentiles must end Jew-hatred like men need to end sexism, Whites must end racism, grownups must end adultism, etc. They can quote the words of protest and analysis of the oppressed, but the latter are busy enough as it is with maintaining unity against infighting and creating a safe home for their fellow oppressed. ‘You made the mess—you clean it up.’
Jew-haters are bad people
Jew-haters are not inherently wicked, or they would be innocent, like you don’t prosecute a false dog. Rather, Jew-hatred is bad, and the hatred must be stopped like we all must be stopped from stealing, being violent, etc.
The media make people into Jew-haters
Most of the media slander the Jews. Yet, you see that some populations are still for Jews and Israel and against Jew-hatred regardless of the slurs. The media only brings out the dormant animosity against the Jews, and that should be stopped, but they don’t cause Jew-hatred. So, we don’t see an uptick in Jew-hatred but an emboldening of those who already hated Jews and a misplaced timidity by the rest. To blame Israel for poorly explaining its case is like blaming the fire brigade rather than the arsonists. Jew-haters often work in key positions in the international and national media, just as pedophiles work more often in the children’s wards than in geriatrics.
Christianity/Islam causes most Jew-hatred
Christians and Muslims throughout history often have been pivotal in spreading Jew-hatred. But many Christians and some Muslims now are staunch allies of Jews. However, they frequently fail to call their fellow haters to order. And too many believe that having a ‘good heart’ is enough. Jews don’t need them to declare themselves ‘the good ones.’ We need them to stop and turn the ‘bad ones’ into ‘good ones.’
Freedom of Speech enables Jew-hatred
It doesn’t need to be like that. Freedom of Speech is part of human rights and democracy. There is no reason to give supremacists who don’t believe in fundamental equality a privilege that belongs to a democratic society. ‘When you’re good to the bad, you’ll end up being bad to the good.’
Many Jews ask why
Jewish knowledge and morality lie at the root of almost all monotheistic religions and cultures. Today, they are 90% of the world’s population. That makes Jews stand out. On top of that, there is tremendous wisdom in Judaism, as in all cultures, but the degree of subtleties (details on details) is enormous. For these two reasons, most people will either honor Jews and feel grateful for what they have given them or be jealous and envious of them. Jews are called upon to help all of humanity, but most people dislike people who (aim to) stand out. That’s why the Holocaust is unlike any other genocide, and Jew-hatred is not just another form of racism.
Jew-hatred is so confusing
It is simple and complex. The best definition is long. Still, it’s incomplete. And this bigotry is ever-morphing, adapting to new conditions continuously. Intersectionality, to stress similarities and solidarity between oppressed groups, seems designed to exclude Jews. Woke excludes working-class men and Jews, falsely typifying them as oppressors rather than oppressed, too. All Peoples in the world deserve national independence, but when the Jewish Nation claims that right too, it’s called imperialism, colonialism, and racism. These clear lies still confuse many left-wingers. But being confused is no excuse for being a passive bystander. Rather, it obliges us to study the issue until we get clarity. Just as with sexism, racism, etc., these social ills are tenacious. We just must be more persistent to let the good cause win.
