How to be a rational pacifist during a defensive war

Crucial is to juggle several principles at the same timeA rational pacifist is not someone who says to a mass murderer, ‘Do whatever you want; I’m a pacifist.’A rational pacifist can neither be someone who says, ‘Ideally, I may be a pacifist, but I’m not crazy, so I’ll hit any potential enemy without mercy.’ ‘All is fair in love and war’ is certainly untrue, both legally and morally.A rational pacifist will watch out not to be too good to the bad because that will always mean or end up in being too bad to the good.First thing that helps staying rational is curtailing anger and hatred. You can hate evil, but not all people you distrust. Anger eats at your humanity.On some level, your empathy should work vis-à-vis people you dislike or who dislike you—even an enemy. It’s better to feel sorry for people trapped in irrational hatred than just to hate back people who hate.Try to think less in monolithic groups. The enemy most likely comprises of ruthless, hate-filled ideologues, strategic leaders, obedient followers, moderate bystanders, and people who dislike what is done by those.Try to look for exceptions. The more extreme your position, the greater the chance you will overlook an inclusion of needless evil in your actions.But even when you must be happy when you succeed to neutralize some out to kill you, regret that they didn’t repent and surrender. They were created in G^d’s image and failed to be moral enough, which is sad.Be grateful for the money, intelligence, and material that protect the innocent and eliminates dangers, but also feel sorry that not more of that money and ingenuity could be spent on eradicating hunger and poverty.In disagreements with others about a war, it is important to avoid needless slandering of people who think differently. Discussion should center on ideas rather than individuals, and should not be aggressive or divisive.Don’t let the necessary and the needless bloodshed harden you. Try to stay flexible—a key component of being intelligent and moral.Are very rational pacifists distinguishable from very moral militarists?
