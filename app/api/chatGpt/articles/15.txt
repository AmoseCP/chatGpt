The bi-directionality of time and the multi-directionality of light and all matter

Some new ideas?
Mathematically, time can function as a fourth dimension.
Then physicists ask, ‘But how can it be that in space we can go in each direction, but in time we cannot? We can go left and right, up and down, and back and forth, but we can’t go back in time?’
Time is faulted for being ‘strange.’ The answer is that not time is unfit; the model is. When a model does not describe reality, reality is not off.

Still, time does have two directions. How?
Take three points in time, A, B, and C, chronologically. And we are at B. Then time went in the direction A to B and goes in the direction B to C.
You’d say, ‘But that’s the same direction!’
But that’s the same direction when you take time as something absolute.
Yet, Einstein said that speed is relative to the observer or location.
Then, time too goes in two directions, to the viewer and from the viewer.

Only the speed of light is absolute.
Only, as Feynman quotes in his QED, photons go in every direction. We may see their sum as a beam and sometimes as a whole wave.
As soon as the wave of a star photon hits our retina, we see it as a dot.
But when the wave hits nothing, it continues as a wave.
Constantly, physics, though sometimes counterintuitive, doesn’t defy logic or imagination. Yet, QM does, which doesn’t bode well for its future.
