Unlimited: Peace Be With You! | Good News Unlimited

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid (John 14:27, ESV).

Twice, Jesus said to his disciples, “Peace be with you!”

Our first peace comes to us when we see the wounds of Jesus and understand that he was crucified and slain for our sins. Peace comes to those who know that Jesus has paid the full penalty for their sins. They have peace in their hearts because they are no longer under God’s condemnation. This is a deep peace.

The second peace takes a person even deeper, because it is hard to enjoy the first peace of salvation while others are missing out on it. The first peace is salvation for you; this second peace comes when you offer salvation to others. Jesus is here commissioning you to go to others to share his salvation with them.

Pray that the Spirit of God himself will fill you and help you bring salvation to others. When you win souls for Jesus, great peace and happiness will fill you to overflowing.

Eli’s Reflection: Which peace are you enjoying, the first peace, or both the first and the second peace? What are you doing in your life to bring salvation to others? Pray that God will open up ways for you to do just that.
