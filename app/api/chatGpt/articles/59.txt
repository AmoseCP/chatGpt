Jesus Chose a Woman

"Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?' Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, 'Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.' Jesus said to her, 'Mary.' She turned and said to him in Aramaic, 'Rabboni!' (which means Teacher)."â€”John 20:15-16, ESV

Have you ever heard God's audible voice?

Whenever I am asked this question, I pause and try to read the inquiring person.

Are they sincere? Just curious? Have they also heard His voice?

The hesitation comes from protecting a sacred moment. I plan to tell the world about Jesus until my last breath, but I only share the time God unveiled Himself while I was all alone on my knees with a limited audience.

When my friend shared her story, I immediately knew it was authentic. She had lost her mom, who suffered from a severe mental illness at a young age. Taking care of her mom was all she had known for the last couple of years. All alone, she found herself in the fetal position on the floor in a puddle of tears. Then she heard God's voice. Immediately, she knew His voice. He said, "I will be your friend."

In our key passage, Mary heard God's voice.

She immediately knew His voice.

I am in awe whenever I read this sacred account of the first Easter. Jesus chose a woman, a beloved friend, as the first person to witness His miraculous resurrection. Mary of Magdala was one of the women who stayed until Jesus spoke His last word on the cross, "Tetelestai." Then, she was given the gift of having her name recorded as the first word our risen Christ spoke. He chose Mary, not the beloved disciple or Peter, who raced to the empty tomb and went home. Jesus visited Mary first and then tasked her to spread the good news to the disciples.

If I could share a cup of coffee with any Bible character, it would be Mary of Magdala. I would ask her what it was like to go from the complete oppression of seven demons to freedom when Christ laid hands on her. What was it like to finally have a friend? I would ask her how she held onto hope when she watched the devastating crucifixion of her deliverer. Then, I would ask her how she loosened her grip and let go of Him that morning in the garden because I don't think I could have obeyed (John 20:17).

Jesus chose to befriend, value, and bestow favor on women when society held females with little regard and often treated them as property. God has always loved His girls. Easter Sunday is a beautiful time to recall God's love, faithfulness, and devotion to us. In fact, every sunrise, sunset, and minute in between is a great time to remember how much He loves us. So much so that He died for us.

Questions for Reflection:

1. Do you long to hear God's voice? Tell Him. Pray for The Spirit to speak to you and then wait expectantly for His perfect timing.
2. Besides an audible voice, in what other ways have you heard God? I often hear The Holy Spirit through people, songs, dreams, nature, and reading The Word. Friend, He is alive and longs for a relationship with us!
